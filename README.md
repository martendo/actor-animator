# [Rhythm Land Actor Animator](https://martendo.github.io/actor-animator)

This tool is not good. Nor is it configurable.
It was made to create actor data specifically for [Rhythm Land](https://github.com/sinusoid-studios/rhythm-land).

I recommend against using this tool, unless you're actually making actors for Rhythm Land.
It's probably got some bugs.

The only reason this repository is public is to show that this tool existed and was used in the making of the game, though it was not used much.

I won't be maintaining this. If you want to build on it for whatever reason, you're free to do so.
